# NodeExpressHandlebars

Description

    This application is based around a form that allows you to submit new hamburgers to a list appended on the web page.
    The application has two lists included, the burgers list, and the devoured list.
    You can add as many burgers to the database as you want using the form.
    Once the burgers are appended to the burgers list using the form, you may devour them, 
    or move them from the burgers list to the devoured list with the click of a button.

Installation

    To create this application, I had to install express, express-handlebars, and mysql.
    In order to install these, first use npm init to create a package.json file, then use npm install for each technology.

Usage

    Open the server.js file in your terminal and run the command "node server.js".
    After this, the console will return a clickable link to the port that the server is listening on. 
    The link will direct you straight to the application where you can add burgers to the list and devour them.
